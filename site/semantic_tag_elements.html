<!-- all of these tages used here are "block lvl elements"-->
<!--I could have used ALL div elements here. However, specific tags relay information within the structure
such as articles 1,2,3 and more related to each other than 4,5,6 b/c they are in 2 different
sections. This wouldn't have been as obvious with just DIV tags.-->
